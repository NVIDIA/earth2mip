This can then be extended to score custom models placed into the model\nregistry. This tutorial also covers details about using a HDF5 datasource, the expected\nformat this data should be formatted and how to use H5 files for evaluating models over\na year's worth of data.\n\nIn summary this notebook will cover the following topics:\n\n- Implementing a basic scoring workflow in Earth-2 MIP\n- HDF5 datasource and the expected data format of the H5 files\n"

        "## Setting up HDF5 data\nThe first step of scoring is handling the target data. One could simply use the\nCDSDatasource to download target data on the fly, but depending on how comprehensive\nthe scoring is, this can prove quite slow.\nAdditionally, many scoring pipelines require on-prem data.\nThus, this will demonstrate how to use the HDF5 datasource.\nThe HDF5 data source assumes that the data to be loaded is stored in the general form:\n::\n\n  year.h5\n      | - field (time, channels, grid)\n\nFor DLWP which requires 7 channels with a time-step size of 12 hours, an H5 file will\nhave the following form of data for an entire year:\n::\n\n  2017.h5\n      | - field (730, 7, 720, 1440)\n  2016.h5\n      | - field (730, 7, 720, 1440)\n  2015.h5\n      | - field (730, 7, 720, 1440)\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>There is some flexibility with the dimensions of the data in the H5 files. The time\n  dimension may be some factor of 12 (such as 6hr dt or 4hr dt) and the fields may\n  contain additional channels not needed by the model. The data source will select the\n  necessary data for the model. Additionally, the later two dims have some flexibility\n  with regridding.</p></div>\n\nOne option to build these H5 files from scratch is to use the ERA5 mirror scripts\nprovided in [Modulus](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/examples/weather/dataset_download).\nFor the rest of this tutorial, it is assumed that 2017.h5 is present for the full year.\n\n"

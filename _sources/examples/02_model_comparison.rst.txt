Basic Inference with Multiple Models
=====================================

The following notebook demonstrates how to use Earth-2 MIP for running different AI
weather models and comparing their outputs. Specifically, this will compare the Pangu
weather model and Deep Learning Weather Prediction (DLWP) mode with an intial state
pulled from the Climate Data Store (CDS). This will also how how to interact with
Earth-2 MIP using Python APIs for greater control over inference workflows.

In summary this notebook will cover the following topics:

- Configuring and setting up Pangu Model Registry and DLWP Model Registry
- Setting up a basic deterministic inferencer for both models
- Running inference in a Python script
- Post processing results

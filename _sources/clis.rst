Command Line Utilities
======================

While one can certainly write their own script using the tools in the
:ref:`api`, this has overhead. For each script, one will need to
initialize the torch distributed group if running in parallel, and write a
submission script if running on the cluster. To simplify deployment, we also
include CLIs corresonding to the common APIs.

class GeoOperator(Protocol):
    """Geo Operator

    This is the most primative functional of Earth-2 MIP which represents a
    operators on geospatial fields. This implies the following two requirements:
        1) The operation must define in and out channel variables representing the
            fields in the input/output arrays.
        2) The operation must define the in and out grid schemas.

    Many auto-gressive models can be represented as a GeoOperator and can maintain a
    internal state. Diagnostic models must be a GeoOperator by definition.

    Warning:
        Geo Function is a concept not full adopted in Earth-2 MIP and is being adopted
        progressively.

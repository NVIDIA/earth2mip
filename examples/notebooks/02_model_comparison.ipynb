    "The following notebook demonstrates how to use Earth-2 MIP for running different AI weather models and comparing their outputs. Specifically, this will compare the Pangu weather model and Deep Learning Weather Prediction (DLWP) mode with an intial state pulled from the Climate Data Store (CDS). This will also how how to interact with Earth-2 MIP using Python APIs for greater control over inference workflows\n",
